# Chords Station
My collection of chord sand tabs for songs that I play too often. Just thought of sharing a good lot of them, through a selfmade platform. 

## How It Works
It's planned to be a responsive dynamic website, that displays chords as the song is played. The song is played through [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) embedded videos, and the data is extracted from the repository itself.

## 1. Association Rule Mining:
  - Using GUHA (General Urinary Hypothesis Automata)
  - Finding Patterns of propogation in different versions of Android
  - For the application, we used [LISp-Miner](https://lispminer.vse.cz/), using the 4-ft Task to extract the association rules.

`Feel Free to contribute and add more chords or better code! I always appreciate constructive criticsm, or you know, flat out a better solution!`
