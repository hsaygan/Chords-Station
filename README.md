# Chords Station
My collection of chord sand tabs for songs that I play too often. Just thought of sharing a good lot of them, through a selfmade platform. 

## How It Works
It's planned to be a responsive dynamic website, that displays chords as the song is played. The song is played through [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) embedded videos, and the data is extracted from the repository itself.

`Feel Free to contribute and add more chords or better code! I always appreciate constructive criticsm, or you know, flat out a better solution!`
