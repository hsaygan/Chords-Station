# Chords Station
My collection of chord sand tabs for songs that I play too often. Just thought of sharing a good lot of them, through a selfmade platform.

## How It Works
It's planned to be a responsive dynamic website, that displays chords as the song is played. The song is played through [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) embedded videos, and the data is extracted from the repository itself.  
Note: The 'Chords Data' is stored in the folder 'Chords' inside the repository itself, categorized by the name of the artists.

## To Do Stuff
    - Synchronize video and displayed chords
    - Add realistic chords for songs
    - Make visually appealing
